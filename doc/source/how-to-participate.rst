How to Participate
==================

You can browse the code at `our github repo <https://github.com/Mirantis/savanna>`_ and :doc:`here <\quickstart>` are the instructions on how to launch Savanna.

If you would like to ask some questions or make proposals,
feel free to reach us on #savanna irc channel at `freenode <http://freenode.net/>`_.
Typically somebody from our team will be online at irc from 6:00 to 20:00 UTC.
You can also contact Savanna community directly by mailto:savanna-all@lists.launchpad.net
(please, note that your email address should be registered in launchpad,
otherwise your mail will be ignored by mailing system).

We're going to hold public weekly meetings on Thursday at 18:00 UTC on our irc channel.

If you want to contribute either to docs or to code, simply send us pull requests via github.
We are going to migrate to Stack Forge later. You can file bugs at `Savanna launchpad page <https://launchpad.net/savanna>`_.
